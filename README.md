MIA stands for "Mi Inteligencia Artificial" that is Spanish for "My Artificial Intelligence" (you had probably figured it out yourself:). Basically the idea is to create one of those artificial intelligence entities we are used to see in sci-fi movies. You probably know Jane (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_(Ender's_Game)) helping Ender all around the Universe, Mother (http://avp.wikia.com/wiki/MU-TH-UR_6000) taking care of the Nostromo spacecraft, Sarah (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARAH) housekeeping Eureka's Sheriff life and, of course, the infamous HAL 9000 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000) trying to survive on 2001: A Space Odyssey. 

The whole name of the project is MIA NOIR/1 that stands for MIA New Order Impious Ruler v1. 

The project is under development at the very early stages.
